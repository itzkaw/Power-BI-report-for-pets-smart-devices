As part of my Nanodegree program, I was assigned the responsibility of creating a professional Power BI report for Waggle, a startup specializing in smart pet devices. 
This report aims to present a comprehensive comparison of their latest product, Lapcat, with their previously successful product, the Lapdog dog collar. 
The initial page highlights distinctions in average step count and potential user rating discrepancies, if any, between the Lapdog and Lapcat devices. 
The subsequent page delves into insights related to pets utilizing these devices, while the third page explores insights pertaining to the families who own these pets.# Power-BI-report-for-pets-smart-devices
